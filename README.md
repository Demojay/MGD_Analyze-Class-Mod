# Monster Girl Dreams - Auto Analyze Code Mod

## Overview
This Mod allows the player to automatically see the stats of monsters that they have already analyzed before. This built upon NobodyWhoBlinds's [Combat API](https://gitgud.io/NobodyWhoBlinds/monster-girl-dreams-combat-api), which is needed to be installed first in order for this mod to work.
The mod was originally made to work on Combat API v1.1c, though will work on the latest version of the Combat API and MGD outside of explicit breaking changes.

The Mod should work on existing saves, but saves should be backed up before use just to be sure.

## Installation
1. Set up the MGD game file folder and Combat API files according to the Readme file installation instructions on the [Combat API page.](https://gitgud.io/NobodyWhoBlinds/monster-girl-dreams-combat-api)
2. Download a fresh copy of the Analyze Mod
3. Extract the files into the MGD folder

## Gameplay
In order to activate the mod, the "Analyze" Class perk must be gained for the player's character.
This perk can be gained by going to the Church, selecting "Pray to the Goddess Statue" and then selecting "MOD: Add Analyze Class"

If needed, the perk can be removed by selcting "MOD: Remove Analyze Class" under the same menu.
When removed, monster's will not be automatically analyzed and the list of analyzed monsters will not be updated, though the list of monsters that have been analyzed will not be lost and can be reused if the perk is regained.

## Prevent Auto Analyze per monster
Included with this mod is the "NoAutoAnalyze" perk, that can be added to monsters such as bosses that will prevent them from being auto-analyzed even if the player has analyzed before.
**By default, no monster has been given this perk**, though it can be added using the base game's modding system.
